Chock full of stories-most never before reprinted-that run the spectrum of twists, surprises and shocks, Marvel Masterworks: Atlas Era Strange Tales features a host of artistic talent rarely seen a single series! So prepare yourself for just a few of the shocks they have in store for you: Werner Roth will find out whether or not you're made of \"Flesh and Blood.\" Joe Sinnot sets off the \"Danger Signal.\" Like it or not, Paul Reinman will discover whether you're \"Man or Beast.\" John Romita sets his sights on \"The Target.\" And Bill Everett reveals \"Karnoff's Plan.\" Marvel Masterworks: Atlas Era Strange Tales is a dark trip into the wry and subversive heyday of horror comics that pushed comics hysteria to the breaking point.

Debuting in 1948, Venus would come to reflect the morphing genres and content of the comic-book industry like almost no other title, and across its run would present some of the most compelling stories of the era. From the beginning, the title featured the goddess of love, Venus, who leaves her immortal throne to seek love as a normal - though stunningly beautiful - mortal on Earth. Publisher Whitney Hammond turns her arrival on Earth into a media event and appoints her editor of his flagging magazine Beauty. Stories on the trials and tribulations of magazine publishing and men smitten by her beauty, however, soon gave way to mythological tales with a fantasy/adventure bent. Increasingly dark in tone, Venus' adventures began to feature scheming Olympian villains set to control, foil or destroy the Earthbound goddess' plans. Trips into the underworld ruled by the Atlas Era's Loki became the norm, and lush artwork by many of the period's top talents graced extended-length stories. Collected here for the first time, this rare fan-favorite title is a must-have for every Atlas aficionado! Collecting VENUS #1-9, LANA #4 and MARVEL MYSTERY COMICS #91.",

        "description": "The MARVEL MASTERWORKS are proud to present one of the most amazing titles and characters in the Marvel pantheon: Venus! Debuting in 1948, Venus would come to reflect the morphing genres and content of the comic-book industry like almost no other title, and across its run would present some of the most compelling stories of the era. From the beginning, the title featured the goddess of love, Venus, who leaves her immortal throne to seek love as a normal - though stunningly beautiful - mortal on Earth. Publisher Whitney Hammond turns her arrival on Earth into a media event and appoints her editor of his flagging magazine Beauty. Stories on the trials and tribulations of magazine publishing and men smitten by her beauty, however, soon gave way to mythological tales with a fantasy/adventure bent. Increasingly dark in tone, Venus' adventures began to feature scheming Olympian villains set to control, foil or destroy the Earthbound goddess' plans. Trips into the underworld ruled by the Atlas Era's Loki became the norm, and lush artwork by many of the period's top talents graced extended-length stories. Collected here for the first time, this rare fan-favorite title is a must-have for every Atlas aficionado! Collecting VENUS #1-9, LANA #4 and MARVEL MYSTERY COMICS #91.",

Then comes the flaming skeleton horseman, Death's-Head - a villain with deep, unknown links to those closest to Daredevil. It's a classic battle that pushes Matt Murdock to reveal his identity to the lovely Karen Page at last - but will it bring them closer together, or force them apart? Also featured are the debut of Stunt-Master; the return of war vet Willie Lincoln; an encounter with the underworld mastermind Crime-Wave; a battle with the triple-threat team-up of Mr. Hyde, Cobra and Jester; the introduction and origin of Nighthawk; and a fight to the finish with the one and only Gladiator! Brought to you by Roy Thomas and the unmatched penciling talent of Gene Colan, they're MASTERWORKS one and all - so reserve your copy today! Collecting DAREDEVIL #54-63.",

There's action aplenty with menacing monsters; sub-earth horrors; super villains out for revenge; and, of course, more than just a few of Cap's World War II Axis enemies gettin' a red-white-and-blue sock in the kisser! You'll see Cap and Bucky grapple with Killer Kole, the reanimated murderer; battle the lovely and lethal Queen Medusa, ruler of towering sub-earth monster worms; go ten frames against the fifth column's bowling alley of death; contend with the return of the super villains the Black Talon and the Black Toad; and fight crocodile-men. And in a special story written by Stan Lee, the dire threat of the Nazi is spelled out in no uncertain terms. To top it off, Cap's tales are backed up by the Human Torch; the Sub-Mariner; Fighting Yank; and Roddy Colt, the war-bond-promoting boy hero also known as the Secret Stamp.

        "description": "In 1974, nobody was kung-fu fighting like Marvel Comics, and at the forefront of the craze was Daniel Rand - the Iron Fist! A Himalayan expedition in search of the mystical mountain city of K'un-Lun left 9-year-old Daniel's father murdered by his partner Harold Meachum and his mother dead. However, Daniel found the path to the K'un-Lun, and there he spent a decade training under its immortal inhabitants. After years of ceaseless tutelage, he became an unmatched master of martial arts and spiritual control; armed with the shattering power of the iron fist, he left immortality behind to set out into the Western world and avenge his parents' deaths. Packed with wall-to-wall kung-fu action, Iron Fist runs a gauntlet through the Kara-Kai death cult and ninja adversaries, and into mystic dimensions where the battle must be fought with mind and spirit. But Iron Fist's saga not only follows Daniel Rand's quest for vengeance - it also introduces Marvel mainstays Colleen Wing and Misty Knight, guest stars the Marvel Bullpen, and brings together for the very first time the creative team of Chris Claremont and John Byrne! It's the beginnings of a true comic-book classic that can only be called a MARVEL MASTERWORKS! Collecting MARVEL PREMIERE #15-25 and IRON FIST #1-2.",

The first appearance of Frank Castle-the Punisher-the maybe-villain, maybe-anti-hero who would rise to become one of Marvel's most famous characters. Topping it off, there's first appearance of the nefarious Jackal, the return of the Vulture, Hammerhead, the hilarious Human Torch-built Spider-Mobile, and the shocking wedding of Aunt May and Doctor Octopus!

He's an enemy so powerful that Thor must team up with the Silver Surfer to match his might.

Stan \"The Man\" Lee and Big John Buscema are back, bringing you a set of comic-book masterpieces as only mighty Marvel could present. So join Thor, Odin, Balder, the lovely lady Sif and the Warriors Three as they confront colossal cosmic threats that only the gods of Asgard can counter. It all starts off with the amazing Infinity epic! An unimaginable destructive force is marching across the universe - one so powerful that before he can face it, the Mighty Thor must travel across Hela's realm of the dead and face off in battle against no less than all-father Odin himself before it can be stopped! It's a father vs. son battle to shake the heavens! And of course, there's treachery a-plenty, courtesy of the mischievous Loki. Teamed with Karnilla, the Norn Queen, Loki won't stop until the throne of Asgard is his, and hell descends upon Earth in the form of Durok the Demolisher. He's an enemy so powerful that Thor must team up with the Silver Surfer to match his might. Then, it all comes to a head when Thor must run a gauntlet of towering Storm Giants before Loki weds the Lady Sif! We'll meet you at the altar! Collecting THOR #184-194.",

Forged in mythology, built for epic adventure and launched on the comic-reading public like a thunderbolt from the blue, the Mighty Thor quickly became one of the standout titles in the revolution that came to be known as the Marvel Age of Comics. Here - in the painstakingly restored, full-color pages of the MARVEL MASTERWORKS - you can experience the early tales of Thor, and witness his evolution and the introduction of his classic cast of characters just like the day they hit newsstands. In this volume, you'll behold the return of Zarrko the Tomorrow Man, the Cobra and Mr. Hyde while witnessing the first appearances of the Enchantress, the Executioner and the Grey Gargoyle. And to top it off, Thor battles X-Men nemesis Magneto, the Avengers drop by, and the Tales of Asgard continue spinning the history of Asgard and the Norse gods.
