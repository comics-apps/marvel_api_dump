Beginning the complete collection of Atlas' action-packed 1950s jungle adventure comics, the Marvel Masterworks venture into the oh, so attractive heart of darkness to meet Lorna, the Jungle Queen! Her jungle-faring father mauled by a lion, the seventeen-year-old Lorna embraces her unexpected new home - becoming a fierce and stunning girl of the wild and the last word in jungle justice! Trained in the ways of the African wilderness by her mentor, M'Tuba, Lorna is joined by her ever-helpful monkey companion, Mikki, and the bold, two-fisted hunter, Greg Knight. From the murky Black Swamp to the Dead Lake, the pre-Code adventures of Lorna and her cast of characters find them pitted against vicious headhunters, voodoo priestesses, killer cavemen from the Lost City, and Agu the Giant-a gorilla that could give King Kong a run for his money! You'll also enjoy the tale of two Lornas and stalk creatures both strange and fierce as Lorna uncovers all the mysteries of the jungle.

Trained in the ways of the African wilderness by her mentor, M'Tuba, Lorna is joined by her ever-helpful monkey companion, Mikki, and the bold, two-fisted hunter, Greg Knight. From the murky Black Swamp to the Dead Lake, the pre-Code adventures of Lorna and her cast of characters find them pitted against vicious headhunters, voodoo priestesses, killer cavemen from the Lost City, and Agu the Giant-a gorilla that could give King Kong a run for his money! You'll also enjoy the tale of two Lornas and stalk creatures both strange and fierce as Lorna uncovers all the mysteries of the jungle. With lush artwork by Werner Roth at his career best, forget it, this is a jungle adventure from which there's no coming back. Get ready to go wild with ATLAS ERA JUNGLE ADVENTURES MASTERWORKS!

        "description": "Prepare yourself for another dramatic dose of monsters from the mind of Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko's strange suspense thrillers from TALES TO ASTONISH! There's more big monster rampages than you can shake a stick at with Trull the Inhuman-a mechanical beast that would make a monster truck shudder- the menace of Moomba, the Creature from Krogarr, the Gorilla-Man, the Abominable Snowman, and the first-ever appearance of Hank Pym, the man who would become Ant-Man! To top it off, there's Steve Ditko's suspenseful shorts that will take you to the farthest reaches of the universe and the darkest depths of the human soul.

        "description": "As America began preparation for the inevitable entry in World War II, a secret military project gave birth to the greatest one-man fighting force ever known-Captain America! Transformed by the Super Soldier Serum from a 97-pound weakling into the Star-Spangled Avenger, Steve Rogers led the charge to liberate the world from the Axis powers' grasp. But before the war's end an accident left Cap frozen in suspended animation and his sidekick Bucky dead, while the world turned on for decades. When the Avengers finally resuscitated him, Steve Rogers was greeted by a world vastly changed. He was a man out of time tormented by the death of his partner, but no less committed to the cause of fighting evil in all its forms. In this inaugural Silver Age Captain America collection, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bring you the rebirth of an American icon in issue after issue of classic Marvel magic. You'll read the classic origins of Cap, Bucky and the Red Skull; see the first appearances of such cornerstone creations as the cosmic cube and the beautiful Sharon Carter; and watch Cap face off against Baron Zemo's Army of Assassins, the Sleepers, Batroc the Leaper, and his Nazi nemesis the Red Skull!

        "description": "As America began preparation for the inevitable entry in World War II, a secret military project gave birth to the greatest one-man fighting force ever known-Captain America! Transformed by the Super Soldier Serum from a 97-pound weakling into the Star-Spangled Avenger, Steve Rogers led the charge to liberate the world from the Axis powers' grasp. But before the war's end an accident left Cap frozen in suspended animation and his sidekick Bucky dead, while the world turned on for decades. When the Avengers finally resuscitated him, Steve Rogers was greeted by a world vastly changed. He was a man out of time tormented by the death of his partner, but no less committed to the cause of fighting evil in all its forms. In this inaugural Silver Age Captain America collection, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bring you the rebirth of an American icon in issue after issue of classic Marvel magic. You'll read the classic origins of Cap, Bucky and the Red Skull; see the first appearances of such cornerstone creations as the cosmic cube and the beautiful Sharon Carter; and watch Cap face off against Baron Zemo's Army of Assassins, the Sleepers, Batroc the Leaper, and his Nazi nemesis the Red Skull!

Draped in the red, white and blue, there's no character in all of comics who represents America like Cap, and within these pages two of Marvel's greatest creators set him on a path through the tumultuous '70s that bears a character's, and a nation's, soul. In story after story Stan Lee and Gene Colan push the envelope for adventure as Cap goes behind enemy lines in Vietnam; teams with the Falcon to oppose the radical Diamondheads; and then sets out on a coast-to-coast road trip full of motorcycle gangs, rock festivals and the Red Skull! The excitement reaches fever pitch when the long, lost Bucky Barnes returns! Free from the guilt of his partner's death, Cap's slate is wiped clean, however, anything but a normal life is ahead-because Baron Strucker, Dr. Doom and M.O.D.O.K. are tied up in Bucky's return. Before the story's done you'll witness Cap vs. Bucky, the origin of M.O.D.O.K. and the beginning of the Captain America/Falcon team! Featuring guest appearances by Nick Fury, the Incredible Hulk and Peter Parker, and villains from Batroc to the Mole Man and the Monster Ape, they're classics one and all.

The excitement reaches fever pitch when the long, lost Bucky Barnes returns! Free from the guilt of his partner's death, Cap's slate is wiped clean, however, anything but a normal life is ahead-because Baron Strucker, Dr. Doom and M.O.D.O.K. are tied up in Bucky's return. Before the story's done you'll witness Cap vs. Bucky, the origin of M.O.D.O.K. and the beginning of the Captain America/Falcon team! Featuring guest appearances by Nick Fury, the Incredible Hulk and Peter Parker, and villains from Batroc to the Mole Man and the Monster Ape, they're classics one and all.

        "description": "Born to a past-his-prime prizefighter, Matt Murdock's luck always ran a step behind his good intentions. When a daring act to save a man's life results in an accident that blinds young Murdock, he finds that the same accident has enhanced his remaining sense to super-human levels. After his father's murder those powers make him Daredevil, the protector of the New York's mean streets. Launched in 1964, Stan Lee and Bill Everett's Daredevil debut was as gritty as they came, a tale of murder and sacrifice tempered with the desire to protect the downtrodden. Matt Murdock was someone different, and you'll see just why in his inaugural Marvel Masterworks! Featuring the first appearances of core characters like Foggy Nelson and Karen Page, as well as classic villains like the Owl, the Purple Man, Stilt-Man and Electro, and guest-appearances by the Fantastic Four and the Sub-Mariner, they're classics as only Stan Lee made them!

Between keeping America safe on the homefront and fighting the Axis powers abroad, the Torch and his kid sidekick Toro have their work cut out for them. They'll face Nazi rockets, Gestapo madmen, fifth columnists and more as they fight the good fight for the U.S.A. The action really gets going in the massive, 45-page \"Death Dance of the Atlantic\" when the Torch and Toro find the Sub-Mariner manning a Nazi U-boat. It's an action-packed dash to capture comics' most tempestuous sometimes-hero and decode the Axis' secret signal system, told in the manner that made Marvel great. Backed up by solo Sub-Mariner tales, along with the boy adventurer Jimmy Jupiter and humor shorts by the likes of Basil Wolverton, every issue is a cornucopia from Marvel's early years.

Stan Lee kicks it off with one of his craziest creations of all time, the Gibbon. And when that bestial baddy teams up with the vengeful Kraven the Hunter-well, it's enough excitement to give a hero an ulcer-and it does! Then, words between Peter's lovely gal Gwen and Aunt May push his doting aunt out of his life and into the arms of-an octopus! Doc Ock returns to do in Spidey, but with Hammerhead, the only gangster with more steel in his dome than in his gun, waging a turf war to take over the city it's open season on spiders! Always a man of the people, Spidey uncovers the machinations of a mayoral candidate who's not quite what he seems. Let's just say there's no doubt Richard Raleigh put the \"action\" in political action, alright?

        "description": "Spinning Spidey's webs to greater and greater heights, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created an unabashed cultural phenomenon in The Amazing Spider-Man. Their blend of Peter Parker's everyday woes, mixed with his webslinging alter ego's super-heroic exploits, was something undeniably special. And after years of perfecting that formula, they unleashed their Spider-Man masterpiece-the Master Planner saga. Spidey roots out the secret hideout of the mastermind that has been terrorizing New York, but he won't take him down without a challenge. Buried under a mountain of machinery with the clock ticking and Aunt May's life on the line, Stan and Steve put Spider-Man through the most wrenching experience of his career and define a hero in the process. They'll also introduce you to Gwen Stacy for the very first time; show you around the campus at E.S.U.; and run the gamut from Kraven the Hunter to \"Just a Guy Named Joe\" before a new talent joins the Spider-Man family. The Jazzy One, John Romita, makes his Spider-Man debut! And oh, what a debut it is! His identity uncovered by the Green Goblin, Spidey finds himself fighting for his life only to discover the Goblin is none other than Norman Osborn. To top it off you'll get the Green Goblin's origin in an edge-of-your-seat Marvel classic, and, as an amazing never-before-seen bonus, the complete pencils to Amazing Spider-Man #31!

Lead by Stan \"The Man\" Lee-in the culmination of his incomparable FF run-and the phenomenal artistry of John Buscema and Joe Sinnott, Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, the Human Torch and the ever-lovin' blue-eyed Thing face-off against their greatest adversary ever. In a word...Galactus! The world devourer returns and either the Silver Surfer must submit to his will or the Earth dies! It's a four-part epic that will make a True Believer out of comic fans young and old. That's worth the price of admission alone, but since we're so nice there's also the Human Torch's struggle to rescue his ladylove Crystal from the alchemical clutches of Diablo; a progressive parable of social consciousness in the Marvel Manner that Stan Lee championed; the secret of the Monster from the Lost Lagoon; and Roy Thomas' regular-series writing debut on a three-part saga featuring the menacing Mole Man and sultry Kala, Queen of the Netherworld-and topped of with a retelling of the FF's origin! Guest-starring the Inhumans, the Black Panther, the world's weirdest babysitter-Agatha Harkness-and Richard Nixon, it's a comic extravaganza as only mighty Marvel can make them!

        "description": "The one and only First Family of Super-Heroing continue their mind-bogglingly imaginative adventures in stories crafted by some of the medium's greatest storytellers. Lead by Stan \"The Man\" Lee-in the culmination of his incomparable FF run-and the phenomenal artistry of John Buscema and Joe Sinnott, Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, the Human Torch and the ever-lovin' blue-eyed Thing face-off against their greatest adversary ever. In a word...Galactus! The world devourer returns and either the Silver Surfer must submit to his will or the Earth dies! It's a four-part epic that will make a True Believer out of comic fans young and old. That's worth the price of admission alone, but since we're so nice there's also the Human Torch's struggle to rescue his ladylove Crystal from the alchemical clutches of Diablo; a progressive parable of social consciousness in the Marvel Manner that Stan Lee championed; the secret of the Monster from the Lost Lagoon; and Roy Thomas' regular-series writing debut on a three-part saga featuring the menacing Mole Man and sultry Kala, Queen of the Netherworld-and topped of with a retelling of the FF's origin! Guest-starring the Inhumans, the Black Panther, the world's weirdest babysitter-Agatha Harkness-and Richard Nixon, it's a comic extravaganza as only mighty Marvel can make them!

        "description": "Because one trip to Attilan and the world of the uncanny Inhumans just wasn't enough, the Marvel Masterworks present the amazing Lee/Kirby creations in their very first self-titled series! Come along and join Black Bolt, Medusa, Triton, Gorgon, Karnak and loveable Lockjaw, as they struggle in battle against both Kree and Skrull in The War of the Three Galaxies! It all begins when Blastaar bursts into the Inhumans' Himalayan refuge to activate an ancient menace designed to devour the entire Inhuman race. That Kree monster is just the first salvo in a war that will lead the Royal Family to the stars and into battle side by side with Captain Marvel. And if cosmos-spanning war isn't enough to keep Black Bolt and company busy, the insane Maximus can always be relied upon to wreak havoc - and then only to whet the appetite for the coming of the Incredible Hulk!

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby bring you another set of adventures with all the power and majesty that one of comics' most-famous runs can bring. Even across their many epics of the Eternal Realm, none can match the build-up and battle that Stan and Jack have for you in these pages! When the dust settles, Loki's evil spells lead to a body-swap between the God of Thunder and his mischievous half-brother that brings Thor to the gates of hell. With Kirby backed by none other than comics legend Neal Adams, it's a comic-art lover's dream! Then Big John Buscema steps up to carry the hammer and wastes no time making history when Thor journeys to Latveria. It's a fight for the ages, and you'll witness Dr. Doom's horrible face revealed to boot! Also featuring Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, Ulik the Troll, the Crypto-Man, the cosmic Stranger and earth-shaking Abomination and Mephisto!

        "description": "The world's favorite space-faring super hero in his continuing saga of anguish and adventure! He sacrificed himself to save his home world of Zenn-La from the planet-devouring menace, Galactus, saving those he loved in exchange for a life of servitude as the Silver Surfer. Now, after disobeying his master, Norrin Radd is stranded on the planet Earth-forever removed from his love, Shalla-Bal, and from the beckoning spaceways! A high point of epic adventure and lyrical drama, The Silver Surfer took the comic-book super hero to all-new heights. Using their ravaged protagonist as a lens through which they could comment on the social injustices of the era, Stan Lee and John Buscema turned the Surfer into the ultimate outsider archetype, reflecting the reader's world in his metallic skin. In these pages the Surfer will face ghosts from beyond the grave seeking redemption, the horrors of war, the devious Mephisto, and mighty Marvel heroes from Spider-Man to the Human Torch and the Inhumans. So what more do you need to know, reserve that copy today, True Believer!

Closing the gap between the end of the X-Men's original series in 1970 and the debut of the All-New, All-Different team in 1975, the Marvel Masterworks present several never-before-collected X-Men tales that set the stage for Giant-Size X-Men #1! First up: Forced underground by anti-mutant hysteria run amok, the X-Men find themselves pursued by a secret adversary that seeks to pick them off one by one. And if being on the run wasn't tough enough, here comes Magneto! Only the combined might of the X-Men and the Avengers can prevent the Master of Magnetism from unleashing a nuclear holocaust. Then, with the X-Men's ranks dwindling, Professor X, Cyclops and Marvel Girl head West for reinforcements, but instead bump into the Incredible Hulk and the Juggernaut. (Ouch!) Next comes the culmination of the classic Secret Empire saga, where the X-Men find they share a common enemy with Captain America and join forces with the shield-slingin' Avenger to save the nation and rescue their mutant comrades. Then, on the eve of the X-Men's departure to face Krakoa the Living Island, Iceman and the Human Torch team-up to battle Equinox, the Thermo-Dynamic Man-and with his team missing, Professor X must enlist the Defenders to fight a resurgent Magneto and Alpha, the Ultimate Mutant! To top it all off, we've also included X-Man-to-be Wolverine's very first appearance! The ol' Canucklehead leaps from the top-secret Weapon X program and throws down in his first famous battle with the Incredible Hulk. It's the all-time classic that made comic book history! There's also the debut of Madrox the Multiple Man-Chris Claremont's first X-Man-and the Beast vs. the Griffin. This X-tra special Masterworks volume polishes off the library of every X-Fan's dreams-completing the original adventures of Marvel's most-famous super team!

        "description": "This is it! The culmination of the Silver Age legacy of Marvel's mutant misfits, the X-Men! Closing the gap between the end of the X-Men's original series in 1970 and the debut of the All-New, All-Different team in 1975, the Marvel Masterworks present several never-before-collected X-Men tales that set the stage for Giant-Size X-Men #1! First up: Forced underground by anti-mutant hysteria run amok, the X-Men find themselves pursued by a secret adversary that seeks to pick them off one by one. And if being on the run wasn't tough enough, here comes Magneto! Only the combined might of the X-Men and the Avengers can prevent the Master of Magnetism from unleashing a nuclear holocaust. Then, with the X-Men's ranks dwindling, Professor X, Cyclops and Marvel Girl head West for reinforcements, but instead bump into the Incredible Hulk and the Juggernaut. (Ouch!) Next comes the culmination of the classic Secret Empire saga, where the X-Men find they share a common enemy with Captain America and join forces with the shield-slingin' Avenger to save the nation and rescue their mutant comrades. Then, on the eve of the X-Men's departure to face Krakoa the Living Island, Iceman and the Human Torch team-up to battle Equinox, the Thermo-Dynamic Man-and with his team missing, Professor X must enlist the Defenders to fight a resurgent Magneto and Alpha, the Ultimate Mutant! To top it all off, we've also included X-Man-to-be Wolverine's very first appearance! The ol' Canucklehead leaps from the top-secret Weapon X program and throws down in his first famous battle with the Incredible Hulk. It's the all-time classic that made comic book history! There's also the debut of Madrox the Multiple Man-Chris Claremont's first X-Man-and the Beast vs. the Griffin. This X-tra special Masterworks volume polishes off the library of every X-Fan's dreams-completing the original adventures of Marvel's most-famous super team!
