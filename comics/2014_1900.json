Meanwhile, the New Mutants battle Freedom Force as they deal with Doug Ramsey's shocking death, and X-Factor befriends Apocalypse's Celestial ship and faces Infectia! But as all three teams fight the Evolutionary War, Limbo's demons begin to pursue a sinister agenda - on Earth!

Powerful anti-mutant bigots have created the ultimate weapon from the ashes of the deceased alien Warlock: a cold, vicious and unstoppable foe that absorbs all in its path. But these Phalanx are far more than their creators bargained for - and they plan to summon their parent race to overtake Earth! When the Phalanx take out the X-Men, the remaining members must split into three teams: to save young mutants from the Phalanx's clutches, to prevent their foes from contacting their homeworld and to rescue the X-Men! But even with the aid of the rogue Phalanx unit Douglock, can these ragtag groups succeed?

What decades-old connection does Professor X have with the secretive Clan Destine? When Synraith returns, the two teams clash - but all is not what it seems! Can the X-Men solve the mystery before Synraith's victory is complete? Then, Generation X guest-stars as Cannonball and Husk return home - but find Humanity's Last Stand waiting! Plus: The X-Babies return, Wolverine takes on Bloodscream, and the Dark Beast targets Bishop. But the real danger lurks in the X-Men's basement! And when Sabretooth finally tears loose, one longtime teammate pays the price! Do the X-Men have what it takes to stop Sabretooth once and for all?

The team takes on the gig to save reality, but is Kate Bishop an enemy in waiting? Will Noh-Varr get an arrow through the head? And is this the end of the loveable/strangle-able Kid Loki? As the Young Avengers take on \"the Young Avengers,\" Loki's scheme reaches its final twist - and the Young Avengers' jaws hit the floor. Then, the team gathers in a nightclub for a string of connected and overlapping stories illustrated by an all-star cast of people we really like. And as the New Year looms, the Young Avengers get a resolution - and so do you. Plus: Kissing! Drama! Conflict! Kissing! Collecting YOUNG AVENGERS (2013) #11-15.",
