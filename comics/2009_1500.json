Heart full of blackest hate and loving every minute of it, he's out to crush the vigilante to pulp - and take his time over killing what remains. But Castle has a lifetime of slaughter behind him, and who knows how lethal he might yet become? Then, watch as Garth Ennis concludes his seminal run on Punisher in style. Thirty-five years ago, the Fifth Cavalry disgorged their troops on an isolated Vietnamese hilltop and was met by a scene of utter devastation. The final body count ran to well over seven-hundred - almost two-hundred of them American soldiers. Standing alone amidst the carnage, a sole survivor: Captain Frank Castle. Now, the Punisher is about to face his stiffest test: He's hunted big game in his day, but none as big as this. Five men with unlimited resources. Men who'd put anything between themselves and the Punisher's bullet. Men who know exactly who he is - and how to fight him.

Skrull Armageddon is just a backdrop for his ultimate revenge- against Tony Stark, against S.H.I.E.L.D., and against anyone that ever stood in his way. And what about Frank Castle? Where does THE PUNISHER fit into Clarke's plans? It's the end of the world as we know it- time to cross some names off the old enemies list. Then, take a trip to the Helter Skelter Club - psychedelic hangout of every costumed wannabe, z-list villain and spandex tryhard in NYC. Its retro-tastic owner - Captain Pepper - has been up to his paisley-print elbows in bad business, but now he's caught the attention of one decidedly ungroovy vigilante.

After busting up a slave ring in downtown Philadelphia, Frank Castle has been tricked, trapped, gassed, strapped to a table and injected with a serum that will turn him into a 220-pound corpse by dawn -- six hours from now.  The people who grabbed him want him to do a simple little job and then they'll give him the antidote -- simple, right?  Guess again.  The Punisher is nobody's errand boy.  There's only one thing he wants to do before he dies: Take as many bastards as he can with him. Plus: there's nothing like fishing with friends, especially when you're about to launch the biggest criminal deal of your careers. On the high seas, life is sweet. That is, until your engine explodes. And your boat sinks. And there's no food or water. And the puking starts. And the backstabbing begins. And the only life preserver is in the hands of a man who wears a black shirt with a skull on it!

        "description": "Celebrated crime novelist Victor Gischler takes on Marvel's greatest vigilante! Traveling the Louisiana back roads with something awful stored in his trunk, Frank Castle stops at a service station on the edge of the bayou...and steps into a world of unspeakable horror. Patrolling the depths of hell, the Punisher has crossed paths with plenty of unsavory characters, but nothing has prepared him for the unspeakable depravity of the Geautreauxs. Plus: Vette's little black book is a treasure chest of dark secrets.  Movie stars, politicians, gangsters - they all pay to play.  Tonight, she is making a house call - and the Punisher is riding shotgun. Because one of the names in that book is Carlos Ramirez, a powerful Miami drug lord who hides in an impenetrable fortress, and Vette is the Punisher's best ticket inside. Before the night is through, Vette will learn a thing or two about what really lurks in the hearts of men, about the difference between dogs and wolves.\r\nExplicit Content ...$14.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-3378-0",

Limbs are lost (the kind you can't easily replace), vultures are fed (with said appendages), and then things get, like, really crazy.  Like back-from-the-dead crazy.  That's right -- she's back and she wants payback.  Ma Gnucci.  Eighty-five pounds of hairless, armless, legless evil.

All children of super-villains, they turned against their evil elders to become amateur super heroes. But when the authorities chase them out of Los Angeles, the Runaways forge an uneasy alliance with East Coast crime boss Kingpin, placing them on a collision course with the killer vigilante Punisher. The ensuing disaster hurls the kids a century backward in time, trapping them in 1907 New York - home of child labor, quaint technology and competing gangs of super-folk known as \"Wonders.\" Can the Runaways get back to the future?

Find out in a timeless tale of comedy, romance and old-fashioned heroism! Collecting RUNAWAYS #25-30.\r\nRated T  ...$9.99\r\nISBN: 978-0-7851-2389-7"
