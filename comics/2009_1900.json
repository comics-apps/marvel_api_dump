        "description": "The dead are still dead and the living are still finding their way through this horribly altered landscape of America. Thus, it's a perfect time to-bring on the bad guys! Randall Flagg performs his first act of magic and begins his cross country journey in a souped-up Buick. And then, there's the strangest addition to the cast yet...Donald Merwin Elbert, the Trashcan Man, a pyromaniac who suddenly has no one to curb his unhealthy obsession with blowing things up. All this plus Rita suggests to Larry Underwood that they should start making their way out of New York, perhaps via...the Lincoln Tunnel!

        "description": "In 1963 the slow boil of the Marvel super-hero revolution exploded in a full eruption with a slate of new heroic adventurers that redefined comic-book adventure forever. Joining the Fantastic Four, the Amazing Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and Dr. Strange came the Avengers and an odd sister book featuring a weird assortment of brand new characters: Cyclops, the Beast, Iceman, the Angel, Marvel Girl, and the mysteriously-named Professor X. They were the X-Men, and little did anyone know that they would come to take the comic book business by storm. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby billed their new creations \"The Strangest Super-Heroes of All!\" and while their mutant powers were certainly weird, the binding concept of this band of heroes, a group feared, hunted and hated because the of prejudice of their fellow man was pure Marvel relevance, striking at the heart of Civil Rights battles of the time. So join us as we collect in this massive, painstakingly restored, archival volume as we recount the earliest adventures of the world's most-famous super-hero team as they encounter for the very first time their nemesis Magneto, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Juggernaut, Ka-Zar and the Savage Land, Master Mold and the Sentinels, and many more of Marvel's greatest heroes and villains. Supplemented with a bevy of behind-the-scenes bonus material, critical and historical essays, and original artwork, this volume is a bona fide must-have for each and every X-addict!

He has revived countless fellow Norse gods, from the brave Balder to the voluminous Volstagg to the treacherous Loki. But what of Odin, the All-Father? Where is the lion of Norse legend, the son of Bor, the one who took a godhood of rambunctious rabble-rousers and made of them a pantheon without peer? Why is he yet to be awakened? The answer is a secret known only by the God of Thunder - a secret buried deep inside a soul filled with the kind of fear and humiliation only a son can feel in the immense shadow of his father.

        "description": "Thor is the favored son of Odin, a paragon of bravery, nobility and strength. From Asgard to Hel and through all realms between, Thor's titanic struggles on behalf of his beloved homeland of fellow immortals have become legend. But what happens when Thor decides to stand down? To not clean up the mess that the gods themselves create? To teach his vain brethren of fellow immortals - and even his father, Odin - that he is not one to take for granted? Ages of Thunder is a story of a god's ultimate destiny toward humility through humanity. Told by superstar writer Matt Fraction (Invincible Iron Man) and luxuriously rendered with bristling action tableaus by a veritable godly pantheon of artists, it is a Thor epic for the ages.
