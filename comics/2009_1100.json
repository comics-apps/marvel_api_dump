Matt Murdock has done battle with Marveldom's most maddening villains - but when he meets the Jester for the very first time, the rules change forever. Framing DD for murder, the Jester sets all of New York on a manhunt for the Man Without Fear! But there's another menace looking to push the stakes even higher: Starr Saxon, the mastermind who discovers DD's secret identity! Then comes the all-time Stan Lee/Gene Colan classic, \"Brother, Take My Hand!\" - a story that marked the ever-advancing march of super-hero comics into the social issues of the '60s by tackling the tale of a blinded Vietnam vet finding his way Stateside. It's a no-question classic! There's plenty of action, too, as DD jumps inside the ring to rub knuckles with Captain America, teeters over the city with Stilt Man, teams-up with the Black Panther and all the while struggles to rebuild his relationship with the lovely Karen Page. And as if that wasn't enough, we're rounding it out with the Stan and Gene's Not Brand Echh side-splitter, \"Scaredevil, Defeated by the Evil Electrifico!\" Collecting DAREDEVIL #42-53 and NOT BRAND ECHH #4.\r<br>272 PGS./All Ages ...$54.99\r<br>ISBN: 978-0-7851-3043-7\r<br>",

Stripped of his family, his humanity, but not his will, Manning has become the cyborg, Deathlok the Demolisher-a weapon of war programmed solely for destruction. A challenging blend of science fiction and psychological war journal, Deathlok set the pace for anti-heroes in the turbulent post-Watergate '70s.

        "description": "The MARVEL MASTERWORKS enter Phase Two of the Marvel Age of Comics with the debut of one of comics' most unique heroes-Deathlok! No longer a man, but a mockery of a man, an amalgam of reanimated flesh and computer circuitry, military strategist Col. Luther Manning has been locked in a state of living death. Stripped of his family, his humanity, but not his will, Manning has become the cyborg, Deathlok the Demolisher-a weapon of war programmed solely for destruction. A challenging blend of science fiction and psychological war journal, Deathlok set the pace for anti-heroes in the turbulent post-Watergate '70s. Illustrated by Rich Buckler and co-written by Doug Moench and Bill Mantlo, Deathlok's feature in ASTONISHING TALES forged a new path and pushed the moral relevance of Marvel Comics into a bold, and often frightening, new future. Collected for the first time ever, the complete Deathlok saga, culminating in a classic cross-time adventure with Captain America, is a must-have for each and every discerning Marvel reader!

Super-hero sidekicks unite when Captain America's pal, Bucky and his Sentinels of Liberty team up with the Human Torch's protégé, Toro, and take on the Axis! And they won't waste a second getting down to business. Right from issue #1 they take the fight straight to Berlin and, rest assured, the Red Skull, and even Hitler himself, won't be walking out of this one without a bloody nose. Next up, the Black Talon returns from the pages of CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS to terrorize the Young Allies, or maybe that should be the other way around? There are 5th Columnists, Nazis, Imperial generals, spies, and action galore in each of these Timely classics.

        "description": "Celebrate Marvel's 70th anniversary by experiencing the tales of the world's most-famous super heroes from the very beginning! The Marvel Masterworks have brought readers deluxe hardcover collections of Marvel's classics from the Golden Age, Atlas Era, and the mighty Marvel Age, and now you can join in the Masterworks excitement with our new, monthly Marvel Masterworks trade paperbacks. And where better to start than where comics' most robust line of archival comic collections began-the Amazing Spider-Man! In 1962 in the pages of a comic book slated for cancellation, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko gave birth to one of the most-enduring icons in American popular culture-the one and only Amazing Spider-Man! Turning the concept of a super hero on its head, they imbued the young, guilt-ridden Peter Parker with the fantastic powers of an arachnid and the fantastic pressures of an everyday teenager. The combination was pure magic. So join us in the following pages as we present stories of spectacular web-slinging adventure from Spidey's very beginning including, the tragic origin that started it all, the first appearances of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, Doctor Octopus, the Sandman, the Vulture, Electro, and guest-star nods by the Fantastic Four and Human Torch. And to top it off, we've packed this volume full of bonuses galore, including the complete original artwork to Spider-Man's Amazing Fantasy #15 origin from the Library of Congress archives!

Teenage outcast and king of the wallflowers, Peter Parker, may have the most amazing powers in the super-hero biz, but good luck coming up with more downsides than this cat. Not only does his boss, J. Jonah Jameson consider him Public Enemy #1, he's sending not just one, but two villains after him-Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, and the vicious Spider-Slayer. And to add insult to injury, the Human Torch one-ups him against the Beetle and the Circus of Crime offers a whole host of reasons to hate peanuts. After that anybody'd need therapy, so Spidey hits the couch, and the couch hits right back with a mysterious foe that's going to give Parker's complexes complexes! To make matters worse, the Green Goblin teams up with the Crime-Master, Aunt May finds a certain red and blue costume, and the Molten Man makes high school graduation a day to remember in Forest Hills, Queens.

Not only does his boss, J. Jonah Jameson consider him Public Enemy #1, he's sending not just one, but two villains after him-Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, and the vicious Spider-Slayer. And to add insult to injury, the Human Torch one-ups him against the Beetle and the Circus of Crime offers a whole host of reasons to hate peanuts. After that anybody'd need therapy, so Spidey hits the couch, and the couch hits right back with a mysterious foe that's going to give Parker's complexes complexes! To make matters worse, the Green Goblin teams up with the Crime-Master, Aunt May finds a certain red and blue costume, and the Molten Man makes high school graduation a day to remember in Forest Hills, Queens. Top that off with a classic team-up between Lee and Ditko's greatest creations, Spidey and Dr. Strange, and you've got yourself a cover-to-cover classic!

Stan Lee and Gil Kane start it off with Peter Parker's attempt to cure himself from his spider-powers gone horribly wrong. Yes, it's the six-armed Spider-Man! And he'll need the extra arms to handle Morbius the Living Vampire, in his first appearance, and the cold rage of Lizard. Rascally Roy Thomas joins the fray and then takes Spidey and his bikini-clad gal, Gwen Stacy, into the forgotten jungle known as the Savage Land to face towering beasts, Kraven the Hunter, and J. Jonah Jameson to boot! When Stan returns the Spider Slayer comes with him, and right behind him is the talented pencil of John Romita. In what Romita cites as the favorite artwork of his storied Spidey career, Stan and the Jazzy One leap into an adventure teaming up Spidey and Doctor Strange against a mystic threat from Vietnam while Flash\r<br>Thompson's life hangs in the balance!

In an innovative twist that would come to define the Avengers, Stan Lee chose to have those original Avengers depart, leaving Captain America alone to carry on.

They've packed so many fantastic firsts into these pages, there's no time to delay so here we go: First you'll meet a new face in the Marvel Universe, the Native American hero, Red Wolf! Then, it's all-out invasion when the Zodiac take over Manhattan, followed by the first appearance of the Defender-to-be, Valkyrie and the Lady Liberators. Then comes a set of other-dimensional threats that helped defined a decade: the sword-and-sorcery menace, Arkon, and the evil super-team, the Squadron Sinister. Follow that up with the origin of the Black Panther, and a crossover classic penned by Roy and the award-winning titan of speculative fiction, Harlan Ellison, that pits the Avengers with the Hulk in an adventure that changed ol' Greenskin forever. With guest-star appearances by Peter Parker, Aunt May, the Fantastic Four, Black Widow, the Inhumans' Medusa, Professor X and Roy Thomas himself there's no denying that the entire Marvel Universe has fallen in for this one, so reserve that copy today, True Believer!

        "description": "Dr. Robert Bruce Banner may have the appearance of a mild-mannered scientist, but after being caught in a gamma bomb explosion, he became the unstoppable engine of destruction known as the Incredible Hulk! Hot off the success of the FANTASTIC FOUR, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's atomic update on the Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde tale, mixed the joy of giant monsters with Cold War intrigue and added a heavy dose of psychological drama to create a formula that even decades later has readers clamoring for more. So for each and every purple pants loving Hulkophile, the MARVEL MASTERWORKS are proud to present the Hulk's original six-issue solo series in one amazingly restored volume.

Responding to their Shakespearean pathos and Kirby's out of this world character designs, the fans loved them-and wanted more! The mysterious origins of Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Triton, Karnak and the rest of their wondrous, secret world was initially revealed in a series of Thor features. But that only whetted reader's appetites-and so came their first headlining series in AMAZING ADVENTURES! Launched by writer/artist Jack Kirby, the new series took the Inhumans to their roots, defending their kingdom against the aggressions of mankind-especially against the ultimate threat of the Mandarin. Then a team with uncanny credentials, Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, took up the crown and sent the Inhumans on a mythical exodus into the world of man. It was a saga exploring the social issues of the era and, of course, topped of with a heavy dose of Inhuman action!

Responding to their Shakespearean pathos and Kirby's out of this world character designs, the fans loved them-and wanted more! The mysterious origins of Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Triton, Karnak and the rest of their wondrous, secret world was initially revealed in a series of Thor features. But that only whetted reader's appetites-and so came their first headlining series in AMAZING ADVENTURES! Launched by writer/artist Jack Kirby, the new series took the Inhumans to their roots, defending their kingdom against the aggressions of mankind-especially against the ultimate threat of the Mandarin. Then a team with uncanny credentials, Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, took up the crown and sent the Inhumans on a mythical exodus into the world of man. It was a saga exploring the social issues of the era and, of course, topped of with a heavy dose of Inhuman action! Also featuring a rare Medusa and Black Bolt tale from MARVEL SUPER-HEROES and a trio of satirical tales from NOT BRAND ECHH by Stan, Jack and their blushing Bullpen!

As if being tethered to one of his oldest foes, The Unicorn, while his life hangs in the balance wasn't threat enough, Tony Stark finds himself replaced by his own S.H.I.E.L.D. Life Model Decoy.

So it's Iron Man vs. Iron Man like never before, while a ghost from the past returns in the form of the mysterious and alluring Madame Masque. That's not all, though! There's the return of the Titanium Man and the Crimson Dynamo, the tragic loss of a loved one, the continuing saga of Madame Masque's torment, a story of voodoo horror delineated by EC Comics great, Johnny Craig, and an epic throw down with the Sub-Mariner while Tony Stark looks to get into the movie business-Masterworks one and all!
