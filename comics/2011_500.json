They say they change their hair color and their name and start lying about their whereabouts and sleeping with rich men and killing them and making deals to sell state secrets with terrorists and stop wearing perfume.  They say all that, but Deadpool never thought it would happen to him.  He never thought his new life as a non-killing dad would start out so blissfully and end up like this -- with his wife having all the fun and him at home taking care of a screaming baby, wondering when its batteries will run out.  Can Deadpool pull his life back together, save his marriage, and stop the spread of the deadly Liquid X?  Probably not, but one out of three ain't bad. ",

Wade Wilson. Codename: Deadpool. He's the CIA's deadliest agent. He's also certifiably insane, suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder and haunted by the ghosts of his past. In other words, he's the perfect soldier in a Cold War where it's impossible to tell friend from foe and reality from a lie. Wilson is also the only one capable of hunting down a rogue CIA agent and recovering the stolen nuclear suitcase she's carrying before she hands it over to America's enemies. But who is this femme fatale, and why has she turned traitor? And is Deadpool crazy enough to survive, or will he become trapped in a web of international intrigue? Collecting DEADPOOL PULP #1-4.",

Wade Wilson. Codename: Deadpool. He's the CIA's deadliest agent. He's also certifiably insane, suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder and haunted by the ghosts of his past. In other words, he's the perfect soldier in a Cold War where it's impossible to tell friend from foe and reality from a lie. Wilson is also the only one capable of hunting down a rogue CIA agent and recovering the stolen nuclear suitcase she's carrying before she hands it over to America's enemies. But who is this femme fatale, and why has she turned traitor? And is Deadpool crazy enough to survive, or will he become trapped in a web of international intrigue? Collecting DEADPOOL PULP #1-4."

In Round 4, gaze in horror upon the fiendish experiments inflicted upon Deadpool and Bessie the Vampire Cow by the malevolent Dr. Kilgore in the name of mad science, and bear witness to their terrible revenge! In Round 5, the voices in Deadpool's head hire him to do the dirtiest job of his career, but the mission is endangered when he's trapped in an elevator with the Watcher! In Round 6, Deadpool realizes there's no government bailout for super-powered mercenaries and is forced to do the unthinkable: look for a job!

Hot-shot super soldier Mike Travers is an all-world athlete and American hero who owes all of his success to Roxxon, the corporation that made him the star of the world's most popular sport, Battlezone! His commanding officer, Luther Manning is just trying to get Travers and rest of his platoon off of the battlefield in one piece. When Travers' on-field heroics get the two of them blown to pieces by an enemy grenade, Roxxon pulls out all of the stops to get their all-star back on the field and get their TV ratings back to the top. The result is a nightmarish melding of the two men's strategic brilliance and bravado, and a marketing bonanza: Deathlok the Demolisher! But the mind of the monster, made up of the fractured psyches of both men, refuses to be tamed and with billions in experimental weaponry at its disposable, Deathlok does precisely what it was manufactured for: DEMOLISHES EVERYTHING!
